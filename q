At age 20, she moved to Europe to pursue a career in modeling; in Spain she was cast in a regular role in the TV show Dark Justice (1991), which was produced in Barcelona for its first season, and she followed it to the shooting locations in Los Angeles the next year. Later she appeared in numerous commercials and TV series, including Matrix (1993), which coincidentally presaged the movie that would make her famous, as well as Models Inc.

Her imposing, sympathetic, and athletic performance in the alternate-world, science-fiction action film immediately thrust her into the spotlight and brought her roles in a number of mainstream Hollywood films, including mob comedy The Crew (2000), sci-fi thriller Kirmizi gezegen (2000), and serial killer drama Suspect Zero (2004). Although she also appeared in the subsequent Matrix sequels Matrix Reloaded (2003) and Matrix Revolutions (2003) (and provided the voices for the video games inspired by the films), Moss cultivated a rich and varied career in independent films. She played an unhappily-married housewife in the Oscar-nominated drama Ã‡ikolata (2000), and starred opposite Guy Pearce in Christopher Nolan's backwards-told thriller Akil Defteri (2000), for which she won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. Other notable indie films included The Chumscrubber (2005), Mini's First Time (2006), Snow Cake (2006), and BahÃ§emdeki ates bÃ¶cekleri (2008).[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mMoss later appeared as Shia LaBeouf's mother in the surprise box office hit SÃ¼phe (2007) and co-starred in the direct-to-DVD thriller Akilalmaz (2010) before undertaking a successful guest-star run on the NBC action comedy Chuck (2007).

His father was from a Lithuanian Jewish/Russian Jewish family, and his mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent.[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mPenn first appeared in roles as strong-headed or unruly youths such as the military cadet defending his academy against closure in Taps (1981), then as fast-talking surfer stoner Jeff Spicoli in Ridgemont Lisesinde Hizli GÃ¼nler (1982).[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mFans and critics were enthused about his obvious talent and he next contributed a stellar performance alongside Timothy Hutton in the Cold War spy thriller GenÃ§ Casuslar (1985), followed by a teaming with icy Christopher Walken in the chilling At Close Range (1986). The youthful Sean then paired up with his then wife, pop diva Madonna in the woeful, and painful, Sangay bonita (1986), which was savaged by the critics, but Sean bounced back with a great job as a hot-headed young cop in Renkler (1988), gave another searing performance as a US soldier in Vietnam committing atrocities in Savas gÃ¼nahlari (1989) and appeared alongside Robert De Niro in the uneven comedy Biz melek degiliz (1989). However, the 1990s was the decade in which Sean really got noticed by critics as a mature, versatile and accomplished actor, with a string of dynamic performances in first-class films.[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mAlmost unrecognisable with frizzy hair and thin rimmed glasses, Penn was simply brilliant as corrupt lawyer David Kleinfeld in the Brian De Palma gangster movie Carlito'nun yolu (1993) and he was still in trouble with authority as a Death Row inmate pleading with a caring nun to save his life in Ã–lÃ¼m yolunda (1995), for which he received his first Oscar nomination. Sean then played the brother of wealthy Michael Douglas, involving him in a mind-snapping scheme in Oyun (1997) and also landed the lead role of Sgt. Eddie Walsh in the star-studded anti-war film Ince kirmizi hat (1998), before finishing the 1990s playing an offbeat jazz musician (and scoring another Oscar nomination) in Tatli ve Kirli (1999).[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mThe gifted and versatile Sean had also moved into directing, with the quirky but interesting The Indian Runner (1991), about two brothers with vastly opposing views on life, and in 1995 he directed Jack Nicholson in Tehlikeli bekleyis (1995). Both films received overall positive reviews from critics. Moving into the new century, Sean remained busy in front of the cameras with even more outstanding work: a mentally disabled father fighting for custody of his seven-year-old daughter (and receiving a third Oscar nomination) for Benim adim sam (2001); an anguished father seeking revenge for his daughter's murder in the gut-wrenching Clint Eastwood-directed Gizemli Nehir (2003) (for which he won the Oscar as Best Actor); a mortally ill college professor in 21 gram (2003) and a possessed businessman in Richard Nixon'a Suikast (2004).[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mCertainly Sean Penn is one of Hollywood's most controversial, progressive and gifted actors.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,
